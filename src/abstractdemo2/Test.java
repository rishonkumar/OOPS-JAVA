package abstractdemo2;

//classes that are partially implemented completed are called abstract classes
// Abstract class cannot create objects and methods

/*

If a class contain at-least one abstract method compulsory class should be abstract
if you don't mention abstract then anyone can create objects of the class

Even if class does not contain abstract method we can declare the class as abstract
        public void m1();
        public void m2();
        dummy implementation if u don't want it to use then use abstract
